# Mars_task_1

Every single problem of the tasked pushed me to explore different or a variety of things possible. 

I'll explain step by step about what I learned and gone through for every problem which i solved.

rather than starting from low dose question will start with high dose question.
in playing with number question, it was the only question which I solved using my current knowledge of C.  I solved that problem using User-defined function and some basic concepts of mathematics.

for the image processing question, I went through PIL library, but it was really taking a lot of time to do, then I did what - I started to learn the things in surrounding to that question only. like I learned how can I implement the threshold variable + Image is nothing but collection of pixels where every pixel represents a 2-Dimensional array of some length and breadth. Learned some basic syntax of python too as I wasn't that much familiar to python. Really enjoyed doing this question because I knew that these things can be also done through basic coding.

coming to the medium dose questions, for the custom data type problem, I went through the given articles and resources, but I didn't get much, so I explored some yt videos there I got a hint, then I implemented it and solved the problem.  I really loved that how we can create a function and call it without assigning it a name by using lambda functions.

For the next question, I went through 2-3 articles, I understand what OOPs is and how it will help in coding with respect to real world scenarios. To be honest, I wasn't getting correct approach for the question even after learning about OOPs, so I took help of chatGPT, there I got some hints then only I coded the things.

for the low dose questions, I was lucky that I attended the frost sessions of the clubs due to them only I had some prior knowledge of Linux and ubuntu . Still, I went through all the resources that was provided + explored some more in order to solve the second problem i.e. shell scripting.

At last, I really enjoyed the whole task and the support that all the leads were giving whether in providing right resources or giving fast responses, everything was so smooth and commendable.
I got a glimpse of other stuffs than our academics, like in image processing, I was like "oh really, I can also do this with coding."
